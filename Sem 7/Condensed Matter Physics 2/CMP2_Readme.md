For mid-sem syllabus, "Superconductiviy, Superfluids and condensates" by Annette is recommended and Chapers 3 and 4 were covered. 
Mid-sem questions were based on those two chapters and exercises at the end of these chapters.

For end-sem syllabus, David Tong's Lecture Notes (1, 2, 3) on Quantum Hall Effect were covered, along with Second Quantization.
